     <h3>Ingredients</h3>       

       <ul>For the Salmon</ul>
        <li>4 salmon fillets (or 1 lb salmon, cut into cubes)</li>     
        <li>3 tbsp sriracha sauce</li>
        <li>2 tbsp honey</li>
        <li>2 tbsp soy sauce (low sodium preferred)</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tbsp lime juice</li>
        <li>1 tsp sesame oil</li>
       
        <ul>For the Bowl</ul>
            <li>2 cups cooked jasmine rice</li>
            <li>2 cups cauliflower florets</li>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>2 tbsp chopped green onions</li>
            <li>1 tbsp chopped cilantro</li>
            <li>1 tsp sesame seeds</li>

         <ol>Directions</ol>
            <li>In a small bowl, whisk together sriracha, honey, soy sauce, minced garlic, lime juice, and sesame oil.</li>
            <li>Cut the salmon into cubes or leave fillets whole. Place in a bowl and coat with half the marinade. Let sit for 15 minutes. Reserve the remaining marinade.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). Toss cauliflower florets with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Spread on a baking sheet and roast for 20-25 minutes until golden and crispy.</li>
            <li>Heat a skillet over medium-high heat with a little oil. Sear the salmon for 2-3 minutes per side (or 4-5 minutes per side for fillets) until caramelized. Pour the reserved marinade over the salmon and let it bubble for 1-2 minutes, creating a thick glaze.</li>
            <li>Divide the cooked rice into bowls. Top with roasted cauliflower and glazed salmon. Garnish with green onions, cilantro, and sesame seeds. Serve warm and enjoy!</li>
